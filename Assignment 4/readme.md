# Assignment 4

Some notes, because I am on Mac I used the SixLabors ImageSharp library because it is cross-platform.

I chose a minecraft texture which is of course included in the TextureCube folder, however, it can be swapped for other textures with the same orient. I couldn't get it to stand upright because of how the cube map is oriented but that is a project for another day.

Please let me know if you are able to run it on your Windows machine as I used Mac to develop this. Thank you

Instructions to run:

1. `cd` to TexturedCube
2. execute `dotnet run`
