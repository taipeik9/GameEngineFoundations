# Assignment 6

For this assignment, I didn't separate the exercises, which I hope is alright. All of the exercises are combined in exercise 5 so I thought that it was fine to just include the final product. I built off of assignment 5 which was great because I had already implemented WASD to move as a fun challenge. I removed the ability to rotate the cube, as the camera would do the "rotating" now, and the lighting gives the final product great perspective as you are moving around the cube.

Honestly, there were not really any challenges with this implementation. All of the code snippets were included in the lecture slides which was great. It was super helpful in terms of learning the new camera system stuff, and I liked the incremental exercise structure, I felt like I was learning a lot. The only challenge was integrating the various code snippets together and also within the GameWindow class. This included reading the documentation to find out which methods needed to be overridden to handle the mouse movement.

Once again, I did this all on Mac. I have generate a `.sln` file with the `dotnet` cli, so hopefully that works. Please let me know if you have any troubles.

Instructions:

1. Ensure you have the dotnet framework installed
2. `cd` to the Cube folder
3. `dotnet run`
4. Use `WASD` to move, mouse to look, scroll to zoom
5. `esc` key to close the window
