# Sprint Game!

In this game, I've implement a title screen, fun movement, a textured cube (crate) along with lighting manipulation.

FYI: there is a demonstration video in the ZIP submission file, so all of this information will be in that recording.

Movement instructions
- WASD keys for moving around
- Space bar to jump
- left control to sprint

Features
- Title screen (two different "scenes")
- Crosshair in the centre of the screen in the 3D scene
- Lighting manipulation with mouse scroll

How to run

1. Ensure that .Net CLI is installed
2. `cd` to SprintGame
3. run `dotnet run`
4. Press the start button (no text) and enjoy!
