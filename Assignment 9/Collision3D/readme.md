# Assignment 9

This was the first assignment where I felt that I was actually developing a Game Engine. I structured the project in a way for growth, and scene management. There is a separate Camera class, Meshes, Mesh factory, Entities which own Meshes and Controllers like PlayerController which operates on the entities. In the future I can add other controllers like Enemy controller which will operate on the enemy entities.

There is AABB collision with the other cube and wall collision.

I would like to add lighting in the future, along with obj loading and actual models.
